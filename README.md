## Getting started

1. Install the `Live Preview` VS Code extension by Microsoft.

   This is needed to run a small webserver that the browser can load the javascrip modules, css3-files and graphics from.

2. In the VS Code file explorer, select `html/index.thtml` and right-click to show the menu.
3. Click 'Show Preview'
4. A terminal is started in VS Code, and in it the URL to open in your browser is printed. See ('./live-preview-screenshot.png')

Now you can test the web app and experiement by changing stuff and see what happens.

## Getting back to the original 

If your happen to end-up in a state where you can't get your changes to work and want to start all over again. You can. But be warned, all your changes will be lost!!!

In the VS code terminal type and then press enter:m
`git reset --hard HEAD`
